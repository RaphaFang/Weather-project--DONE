# 🌤️Weather Forecaster
A project that displays daily and weekly weather forecasts for Taiwan, based on APIs from the Central Weather Administration (CWA) of Taiwan.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of **Git Flow** in a collaborative development environment. This includes the use of feature branches, pull requests, code reviews prior to merging, and conflict resolution.

You can view the **[Pull Request](https://github.com/Annie0121/weather/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)**  from the original project repository to observe the workflow and my contributions to the team effort. *(If the link is not available, please view the [commit history](https://github.com/RaphaFang/Weather-project--DONE/commits/main/) instead.)* The project was completed over a 5-day development period.
